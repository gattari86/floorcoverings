## Report Sections & Key Insights

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Key Finding:** 40% decline = 30% bot filter + 40% algorithm shift + 30% construction friction
- **Investment Required:** $0-1,000/month (Phases 1-4 are free)
- **Timeline to Recovery:** 18-24 weeks

### 2. Forensic Traffic Analysis (Section 1)
**Root Cause #1: September 2025 Reporting Glitch (30% of decline)**
- Google removed `&num=100` parameter that rank-tracking bots used
- Removed bot impressions from Search Console
- This is "ghost data" that never represented real customers

**Root Cause #2: October/November Core Updates (40% of decline)**
- Shifted from "keyword relevance" to "popularity" ranking factor
- Algorithm now rewards active engagement velocity (reviews, updates, interactions)
- AI Overviews reduced organic clicks for informational queries

**Root Cause #3: I-610 Construction (30% of decline)**
- Major infrastructure disruption isolated the location
- 3-mile commute now takes 25+ minutes
- Google Maps calculates longer distance = algorithm deprioritizes location

### 3. Entity Audit (Section 2)
**Competitive Advantage: Reinel Solano's Engineering Background**
- Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering (UT Austin)
- 3 years at Ecopetrol (Colombian National Oil Company)
- Tenure at BP

**Strategic Positioning:** "Precision Flooring. Engineered for Houston."

This differentiates FCI from:
- Roberts Carpet (impersonal, corporate)
- Greater Houston Flooring (artisan, but limited scope)
- Lowe's (commodity, no expertise)

### 4. Market Context (Section 3)
- Houston's "Lock-In Effect": High rates = renovation-in-place market
- Heights demographic: Historic bungalows (pier-and-beam) + modern townhomes
- FCI's "disaster recovery" niche (water heater flooding) is under-marketed

### 5. Competitive Analysis (Section 4)
**4-Player Competitive Matrix:**
- Roberts Carpet: 9 locations, 40+ years, massive domain authority
- Greater Houston Flooring: Artisan wood specialist, 5.0★ rating
- Lowe's: Big Box, 6.3 miles away, price-focused
- FCI: Mobile showroom, 4.85★ rating, engineering pedigree

**FCI's Exploitation Opportunities:**
- vs Roberts: Personal expertise (Solano) beats corporate
- vs GHF: Eco-friendly flooring (bamboo/cork) niche
- vs Lowe's: White-glove service vs commodity retail

### 6. Technical Audit (Section 5)
**Critical Issues:**
- Website: Generic franchise content (penalized by "Helpful Content" update)
- GBP: Service area sprawl (Kingwood, Humble, Woodlands dilutes focus)
- Social: Inconsistent posting (algorithm wants "pulse")
- Reviews: Low velocity (1-2/month vs competitors' 2-3/week)

### 7. 5-Phase Recovery Roadmap (Section 6)

**Phase 1: Brand Repositioning (2-3 weeks, $0)**
- Rewrite homepage around "Precision Flooring. Engineered for Houston."
- Create "FCI Precision Protocol" process page
- Leverage Solano's engineering credibility

**Phase 2: Hyper-Local SEO (4-6 weeks, $0-500)**
- Neighborhood landing pages (Heights, Garden Oaks, Rice Military)
- Turn I-610 construction into messaging advantage
- Position mobile showroom as solution to traffic chaos

**Phase 3: Popularity Engine (Ongoing, $0)**
- Increase review velocity to 2-3/week
- Train sales (Chris Aboshear) on semantic review generation
- 2x weekly "Project Pulse" posts on GBP + Instagram

**Phase 4: Technical Clean-Up (1-2 weeks, $0)**
- Prune service areas (focus Inner Loop + North)
- Optimize primary category to "Flooring Contractor"
- Reset analytics baseline (exclude pre-Sept 2025 bot data)

**Phase 5: Competitive Gaps (6-8 weeks, $500-1,000/month)**
- Google Local Service Ads targeting "Lowe's complaints"
- Eco-friendly flooring content (bamboo/cork)
- Position as premium alternative to big box
